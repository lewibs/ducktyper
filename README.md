# DuckTyper
A tool for validating input based on the fundimental js idea of duck typing. The concept of this is to allow the fluidness of a dynamically typed language with the clarity of a static one. It takes advantage of a typing that is commonly known in js as duck typing. Meaning, If it walks and talks like a duck it's a duck.
<br/>

While duck typing exists in typscript (and many new languages), in my opinion, it could be done better. DuckTyper has the single goal of having simple and clear syntax. It follows similar design patterns of styled-components, which are easy, quick, and clear to make.
<br/>

It was designed functionally, and as a result opperates best when used as such. However, a clasical version is included which can be found here: https://github.com/lewibs/ducktyper/blob/main/classes/Duck.js
